Cairo's history spans over a millennium, marked by its founding in 969 CE by the Fatimid dynasty. However, the region’s significance dates back much further, as the nearby Giza Plateau is home to the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx, symbols of Egypt’s ancient civilization. Throughout the centuries, Cairo became a cultural and political hub, enriched by Mamluk, Ottoman, and colonial influences. Today, its historical legacy is evident in its Islamic architecture, Coptic churches, and vibrant neighborhoods, offering visitors a fascinating journey through time.
