Bangkok‚Äôs history dates back to 1782, when it became the capital under King Rama I, marking the start of the Chakri Dynasty. Originally a small trading post, it rapidly transformed into a cultural and political hub. The construction of iconic landmarks such as the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew symbolizes its deep-rooted connection to Thailand‚Äôs monarchy. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Bangkok evolved into a thriving international city while preserving its historic charm. Today, it stands as a testament to Thailand‚Äôs vibrant past and dynamic present.

### Weather and Best Time to Visit

Bangkok‚Äôs tropical climate makes it warm and humid year-round, with three distinct seasons: hot, rainy, and cool. The best time to visit is during the cool season (November to February), when temperatures range from 23¬∞C to 30¬∞C (73¬∞F to 86¬∞F) and humidity is lower, making it ideal for exploring the city.
