Originally known as Edo, Tokyo's history dates back to the 12th century when it was a modest fishing village. The city's prominence rose significantly in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established the Tokugawa Shogunate, making Edo the political center of Japan. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Emperor moved the capital from Kyoto to Edo, renaming it Tokyo, meaning "Eastern Capital." Since then, Tokyo has evolved into a major international city, balancing its rich historical heritage with rapid modernization.
